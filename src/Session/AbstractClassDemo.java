/*
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated(cannot make object) on its own and is meant to be inherited by subclasses.
- It can have abstract methods (without implementation/body) as well as concrete methods (with implementation/body).

Important Points:
| Feature                   | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abstract` keyword        | Used to declare a "class or method" abstract                                           |
| Can't instantiate         | You cannot do `new Animal()` if Animal is abstract                                     |
| Can have constructors     | Used to initialize common fields                                                       |
| Can have concrete methods | Unlike interfaces (before Java 8), abstract classes can define method bodies           |
| Can have member variables | Both final and non-final, static or non-static                                         |
| Supports inheritance      | Subclasses must implement all "abstract methods" unless they are abstract themselves   |
